# Commission Autosorter

This project works together with [ALAS](https://github.com/LmeSzinc/AzurLaneAutoScript).
ALAS tells you what commission rewards you got, but thousands of commissions can be annoying.
I wrote this to make the sorting process (which probably no one other than me does)
easier.

## Usage

Put stuff in TODO folder and run the script that has your desired effect. Check the results in
the folder that pops up.

I will see if I can write `requirements.txt`, but that's when I happen to have the time.

## What's here

Alas stacks up all the commissions it checks at one time, which is kind of annoying.
So I wrote a script to divide them into separate stacks.

Also ALAS does not check if the commission is a major success, so I added that as well.

Here's what else I want to do:
- Add a way to check which sort of commission it is by checking the reward image
- Remove the main page image that ALAS sometimes mistakenly puts into the screenshot
